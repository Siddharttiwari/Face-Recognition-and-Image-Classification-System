# Face-Recognition-and-Image-Classification-System
This project implements a Face Recognition and Image Classification system using OpenCV, Scikit-learn, and machine learning techniques. It allows for face and eye detection, feature extraction, and classification of images into multiple categories based on trained models.

üîç Features

Face and eye detection using Haar cascades (OpenCV)

Feature extraction using raw pixel data and wavelet transform

Training using Scikit-learn classifiers (e.g., SVM, RandomForest, etc.)

Model selection and optimization via GridSearchCV

Save/load model with joblib for inference

Real-time prediction on images


üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Scikit-learn (sklearn)

PyWavelets (pywt)

Matplotlib (for visualization)
